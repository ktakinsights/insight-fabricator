    "This is a supplement to the main report available on the Medicare claims data.  As with the base analysis, a better understanding of the data can help inform better decision-making.  We already looked at how spending is different across age groups, gender, and other factors.  The exploratory data analysis included some visualizations and basic statistical tests.  This extension will include three stages of more advanced analytical techniques.  We will focus on specific medical procedures, try to predict future costs and find new insights by comparing different parts of the data. This new project will give us a better understanding of Medicare spending."
